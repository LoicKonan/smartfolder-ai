    },
    {
        "q": "Can I customize naming or folders?",
        "a": "Yes â€” fully configurable templates like Type_Project_Date or Project-Type. You can set up your own naming conventions in Settings."
    },
    {
        "q": "Is it team-ready?",
        "a": "Yes â€” multi-user & workspace support is in the roadmap. We're building features for team collaboration and shared workspaces."
    },
    {
        "q": "What email accounts are supported?",
        "a": "Gmail for now. Microsoft/Outlook and more email providers are coming in future updates."
    },
    {
        "q": "How secure is my data?",
        "a": "Very secure. We use industry-standard encryption, and your files never leave your system unless you choose cloud deployment."
    },
    {
        "q": "Can I automate file organization?",
        "a": "Yes! Set up rules once, and SmartFolder AI will automatically organize files based on your preferences."
